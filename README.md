## Hi there! I'm Synthird! 👋

- 🕛 I have been programming since mid 2020
- 🕹️ I got into programming when I started learning to make video games
  - 🎮 You can play the ones I published on [itch](https://synthird.itch.io)
- 🎨 I also create [art](https://cara.app/synthird)
- I never use "AI"
  - Except for making commit messages on the site (Because that is enforced and I don't know how to turn it off)
- ⚡ Fun fact: You are reading this in the present!
