## <> Hi there! I'm Synthird! </>

- 🕛 I have been programming since mid 2020
  - 🕹️ I got into it when I started learning to make video games (Like [these ones](https://synthird.itch.io) I published)
  - 📘 The first language I learned was [Lua](https://lua.org/)
- 🎨 I also create [art](https://cara.app/synthird)
- I never use "AI" that spit out or edit text, code, images, videos, audio, graphs, etc.
- ⚡ Fun fact: You are reading this in the present!
